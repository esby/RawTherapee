News Relevant to Photographers
------------------------------
- RawTherapee 5 supports most raw formats, including some unusual ones like those from cameras using Foveon and X-Trans sensors. If you're wondering whether it supports your camera's raw format, first download RawTherapee 5 and try for yourself. If a raw format is not supported it will either not open, or the preview in the Editor tab will appear black, white, or have a strong color cast - usually magenta. In that case, read the "Adding Support for New Raw Formats" RawPedia article.

In order to use RawTherapee efficiently you should know that:
- You can scroll all panels using the mouse scroll-wheel.
- You can right-click on a tool's name to automatically expand it while collapsing all others.
- To change slider values or drop-down list items with the mouse scroll-wheel, hold the Shift key. This is so that you can safely scroll the panels without accidentally changing a slider or other tool setting.
- All curves support the Shift and Ctrl keys while dragging a point. Shift+drag makes the point snap to meaningful axes (top, bottom, diagonal, other), while Ctrl+drag makes your mouse movement super-fine for precise point positioning.
- There are many keyboard shortcuts which make working with RawTherapee much faster and give you greater control. Make sure you familiarize yourself with them on RawPedia's "Keyboard Shortcuts" page!

New Features:
- Wavelets tool.
- Retinex tool.
- Monitor profile and rendering intent support.
- Print soft-proofing support.
- Automatic chroma noise reduction, manual luminance noise reduction using sliders and curves.
- The "Inspect" tab in the File Browser lets you see a 100% preview of the image whose thumbnail your mouse cursor hovers over, which is either the largest JPEG image embedded in the raw file or the image itself when hovering over non-raw images.
- The curve pipette allows you to pick the right point of a curve by clicking in the preview, and input/output values so that you can set the desired output value for a given input value.
- Post-resize sharpening, to give your photos that subtle crispness after resizing them.
- Dual-illuminant DCP support with curves, base tables, look tables and baseline exposure.
- New exposure tone curve modes "Luminance" and "Perceptual".
- Queue processing will stop if an error is encountered while saving, e.g. if you run out of disk space.
- The Contrast by Detail Levels tool received the "Process Locate Before/After Black-and-White" option.
- Rec. 2020 ICC profile added.
- The Navigator can show RGB, HSV and L*a*b* values in a range of 0-255, 0-1 or %.
- The Lockable Color Picker allows you to place multiple sample points over the preview to measure colors and see them change in real time as you manipulate the image. They support the same ranges as the Navigator.
- Grayscale JPEG and TIFF images are now supported.
- 32-bit TIFF files are supported.
- In addition to these new features, RawTherapee received over two years worth of amazing speedups, code cleanups and bug fixes, making it faster and more stable than ever before!

News Relevant to Package Maintainers
------------------------------------
- Branch "master" uses GTK2, branch "gtk3" requires GTK+ >=3.16. There are known bugs using GTK+ versions 3.20-3.22 where scrollbars may appear stuck (issue #3545) and where the Retinex tool's "Gain and Offset" panel may appear under the "Transmission" panel (issue #3525) until the user hovers the mouse cursor over a curve button. For this reason we recommend using GTK+ 3.16-3.18 if possible.
- RawTherapee 5 requires GCC-4.9 or higher, or Clang.
- Do not use -ffast-math
- Use -o3
- For stable builds (RT5) use -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX=""
- For development builds use -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX="5-dev"
- Windows builders should compile on a drive letter which users are most unlikely to have, such as Y:, due to the "There is no disk in the drive" error (issue #3544).

News Relevant to Developers
---------------------------
- Use C++11
- Code must be run through astyle.
- Commits automatically trigger a compilation using Travis CI.
